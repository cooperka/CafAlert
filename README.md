# CafAlert

Provides quick access to University of Michigan cafeteria menus, and custom alerts for food being served.

*This project was done a long time ago, mostly in the fall of 2011.*

## Installation

This project is set up for Android Studio. Simply clone the repo and open it up with Android Studio if you want to run it. The original version was also available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kac.caf), but likely isn't accessible anymore.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage

## History

This was the second Android app I ever wrote. I was frustrated with the cafeteria website at the time (it heavily relied on JavaScript and was almost impossible to use on mobile) so I decided to make a work-around. It worked really well, and I actually used this app nearly every day of my freshman year to see what was being served in the cafeterias.

Like [Search SMS](https://github.com/cooperka/SearchSMS), it's novice, outdated, and generally rough around the edges; in fact, it's terrible. It also doesn't work anymore, since the U of M website has changed so much. I emailed whoever was in charge of the website sometime around sophomore year to ask if they could provide me with a stable API, but they declined, so I stopped developing it.

Note:
All the code here is in its original form, and hasn't been modified since I wrote it in 2011, during my Freshman year of college. I fixed up the spacing a bit so I wouldn't go crazy reading it, but that's it.
